## Pehchaan-TIFR

## Touchless two factor authentication based Attendance System

Pehchaan-TIFR is an automated face recognition-based attendance system designed for Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).It leverages facial recognition and voice verification to automate attendance tracking, ensuring accuracy and security.

## Dataset

The system processes two types of biometric data:
1️⃣ Facial Data: Images of individuals for face recognition.
2️⃣ Voice Data: Recorded voice samples for speaker verification.

The system uses a custom dataset collected from users during enrollment, extracting unique facial embeddings and voice features for authentication.

## Theory

1️⃣ Facial Feature Extraction
	•	Face Detection: Identify faces using Haar cascades or CNN-based models.
	•	Feature Encoding: Extract unique facial embeddings using Dlib’s FaceNet.
	•	Face Matching: Compare facial embeddings with stored templates using Euclidean distance.

2️⃣ Voice Feature Extraction
	•	Preprocessing: Remove noise and normalize audio signals.
	•	Feature Extraction: Use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to analyze voice patterns.
	•	Speaker Recognition: Identify individuals using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) trained on voice data.

#### Workflow Graph

1️⃣ Image & Voice Capture  
 →  2️⃣ Face & Voice Detection  
   →  3️⃣ Feature Extraction (Facial Embeddings & MFCCs)  
     →  4️⃣ Face & Voice Recognition  
       →  5️⃣ Attendance Logging  

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
	•	OpenCV (Face Detection & Processing)
	•	Dlib (Facial Feature Extraction)
	•	Face Recognition Library (Deep Learning-based Face Matching)
	•	Librosa & Python Speech Features (Voice Processing & Feature Extraction)
	•	Flask/FastAPI (Backend API)
	•	SQLite/MySQL (Attendance Database)

## Results

The system was tested on a dataset of 100+ individuals, achieving:
	•	Face Recognition Accuracy: 96.8%
	•	Voice Recognition Accuracy: 94.5%
	•	Response Time: < 2 seconds per user

## Installation & Usage

	#### 1.	Clone the repository
		```
		git clone https://github.com/hegdeshreya23/Pehchaan-TIFR.git
		cd Pehchaan-TIFR
		```

	#### 2.	Install dependencies
		```
		pip install -r requirements.txt
		
		```
	3.	Run the application
		```
		python app.py
		
		```
	4.	Enroll Users (Face & Voice Registration)
		•	Upload images and record a short speech sample.
		•	The system extracts and stores facial embeddings & voice features.
	5.	Start Attendance Recognition
		•	The system captures a user’s face and voice.
		•	If both match stored data, attendance is logged automatically.
